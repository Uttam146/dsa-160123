// Nice Subsequence
// Question Name: Nice Subsequence

// Problem Statement

// Given an array A consisting of N integers.

// A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given array by deleting zero or more elements(not all) without changing the order of the remaining elements.

// A nice subsequence is a subsequence of array A in which the difference between any two elements equals the difference between their original indices in array A.

// More formally a subsequence [Ai1 Ai2 Ai3 â€¦ AiL] of array A is nice if for any 1<=p,q<=L, Aip-Aiq = ip-iq holds.

// Now you have to find the largest possible length of a nice subsequence of array A.

// Input Format

// First line contains a single integer denoting N.
// Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of array A.
// Output Format

// Print the largest possible length of a nice subsequence of array A.
// Constraints

// 1<=N<=105
// 1<=Ai<=109
// Sample Input 1

// 6

// 2 1 4 10 7 7

// Sample Output 1

// 3

// Explanation of Sample 1

// A possible nice subsequence of length 3 is [A1 A3 A6] = [2 4 7]



// Things to Note for the Candidate

// You can use your own IDE like Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, or any other IDE that you are comfortable with to build your solution code.
// The IDE provided on the platform is purely for submission. Avoid using the IDE for coding out the solution.
// Test against any custom input in your own IDE. In the IDE provided on the platform, you cannot pass custom test cases and see the output. 
// Use standard input and standard output in your program for the IDE to run the test cases smoothly against your code. We are giving a sample problem statement along with a solution that will pass the test cases in the IDE. - Sample Problem Statement  (Right Click and Open in New Tab to view.)


//Solution :- From the given question the equation is Aip-Aiq = ip-iq, where A is array and ip is iq is index.
//we can say that Aip - ip and Aiq - iq
